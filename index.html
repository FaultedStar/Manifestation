<p>Your Designs are important </p>
<p>Everyone experiences the world differently, every designer has a unique perspective and set of influences that shapes their design practice. How will anyone truly know YOU till they know what YOU value and are inspired by. Show your interests and beliefs though everything you make. </p>

<p>Make sure at least ONE person likes your design. </p>
<p>And make that person you. You are the only one that matters while judging your   designs because there is no point in trying to please everyone. There is no universal good so if you are happy with your work, it is good. </p>

<p>Make things that make you happy.</p>
<p>Design projects that are based in others ideals make for lackluster designs. Make  things worth getting excited about. How can you inspire others if you can’t inspire yourself? Life is too short to make shitty designs for people you don’t care about. </p>
	
<p>Scratch your own itch (Fisher, 2014). </p>
 <p>Inspiration comes from the self, so create solutions for problems you experience. Immerse yourself in the subject you are designing and work from the heart towards goals you care about.Self expression leads to proud work. Go make good things before someone else does. </p> 


<p>Don't join in competition(Mau, 2010-2014), it's not healthy.</p>
<p>Competition pits your designs against others work and this isn't good for design. Your work isn't as good as a judge says it is, it's as good as you make it. While criticism is helpful one must accept that everything is a draft (Pettis & Stark, 2010-2014) and not get hung up on one upping your colleagues; only yourself. </p>   

<p>Designing for yourself doesn't have to be selfish.</p>
<p>Care about a problem enough to change it. You don't have so solve every problem and care about every issue, but keep in mind the ones you do care about. A person that cares will do the most good towards a project. Care about it, do it.  </p> 

<p>Don’t compromise.</p>
<p>Your ideals are important and you should strive to remain as true to them as possible. Just accept that you know what you’re doing (even if you don’t) and roll with it. This will bring out your individual flair. Don’t be cool (Mau, 2010-2014), cool is constructed from mainstream acceptance. Work to be free from other corruptive influences. </p>
